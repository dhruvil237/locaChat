# locaChat
You are unknown, but not alone...

A location-based chat-app to share important/interesting information to the nearby users anonymously. Let's say a user A broadcasts a message in the super chat interface provided in the App. The chat will be visible to all the users using the App within a 2km radius of user A.

## Objective of the project

There are many crucial problems locaChat is capable of solving :

**1) Share vital information about
surrounding :** 

There are times when we feel lost and
confused in a location, ask locaChatters.
They will guide you around the area and
suggest must-visit places. Questions like good places to eat or free car parking spots or events happening around your location can be reliably answered.

**2) Maintaining anonymity while
sharing information with a crowd :** 

There are certain risks this
application carries like **Identity Theft, Information Misuse and User's physical security**. To overcome them, the identity of any user
will *not* be revealed. We will have only
google account sign-in and email sign in
options in our app.

**3) Conveying weather and disaster
alerts effectively:** 

At times of unexpected disasters, the panic and
stampede makes effective communication
impossible. locaChat comes to the rescue here.
A simple text message can save precious lives.

**4) Conveying crime and security alerts effectively :**

Alert others of dangers in the area anonymously,
such as a **gunman on the loose, robbery, terrorist
activities.**
