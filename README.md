# locaChat
You are unknown, but not alone...

A location-based chat-app to share important/interesting information to the nearby users anonymously. Let's say a user A broadcasts a message in the super chat interface provided in the App. The chat will be visible to all the users using the App within a 2km radius of user A.

## Objective of the project

There are many crucial problems locaChat is capable of solving :

**1) Share vital information about
surrounding :** 

There are times when we feel lost and
confused in a location, ask locaChatters.
They will guide you around the area and
suggest must-visit places. Questions like good places to eat or free car parking spots or events happening around your location can be reliably answered.

**2) Maintaining anonymity while
sharing information with a crowd :** 

There are certain risks this
application carries like **Identity Theft, Information Misuse and User's physical security**. To overcome them, the identity of any user
will *not* be revealed. We will have only
google account sign-in and email sign in
options in our app.

**3) Conveying weather and disaster
alerts effectively:** 

At times of unexpected disasters, the panic and
stampede makes effective communication
impossible. locaChat comes to the rescue here.
A simple text message can save precious lives.

**4) Conveying crime and security alerts effectively :**

Alert others of dangers in the area anonymously,
such as a **gunman on the loose, robbery, terrorist
activities.**

## Description 
This app would allow users to anonymously send
messages to other users based on their location. The
app would be useful for transmitting important
information to strangers in one's vicinity, such as alerts
about a natural disaster or a crime or just a discussion
about things happening in the surroundings. Users
would be able to broadcast messages to any other user
within that radius of 2km using the app. Chatrooms for
special events would also be possible using the app.
